I wanted to proove the linearity of the size of the blur circle along the line between the near/far focus.

At the same time, this gives a much simpler demonstration !

Here we just want to calculate the size of the blur circle s.

If y > x

Depending on the distance of the distant plane yand aperture a;

s = a(y-x)/y = a (1-x/y)
But instead of having a relation depending on y, we want it as a function of d which is the distance between the point O and the image of A on the focus plane.

BC = (x/y)h

d = h - (x/y)h

This means we have;

x/y = (h-d)/h
so s = a(1 - (h-d)/h)

Equation 1: s = (a/h) * d

The size of the blurry disk varies proportionnally with distance d

If y < x

Let me save some efforts but with the same logic we will find that

Equation 2: s = -(a/h) * d

d is the abscissa and will be negative

So the blurry disk size is proportional to distance d, anf of course equals 0 when d=0 (means no blur  on the focus plane)

Of course now no need for the previous demonstration, this also demonstrates that we simply need to focus at the midpoint (in the image).

Looks good ? This is simple in fact.
